# Diffing Arbitrary R objects

The Avant API can be used to fetch credit decision information for particular loans to
determine what the business rules in conjunction with a given model score might produce. This
is very useful for backtesting strategies to determine business sanity. For example, we would
usually like to generate amount and APR distributions based on a candidate future model to
ensure it does not shift things too radically from a previous model.
